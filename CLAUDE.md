# Secretary — working notes for Claude Code

Source of truth for the design is `SPEC.md`. This file tracks where the build actually is.
Update it at the end of every session (spec §11).

## Current phase: Phase 0 — built and mostly verified; the full §7 restart test was deliberately skipped

## What works (verified 2026-09-15)
- Electron 44 + React 19 + Vite 7 + Tailwind 4 + TypeScript, built with `electron-vite`.
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3` v13. **No native rebuild needed**: v13 ships N-API prebuilds
  (`node_modules/better-sqlite3/prebuilds/win32-x64.node`) that load under Electron as-is.
  There is no Visual Studio on this machine, so never add a `node-gyp rebuild` / `electron-rebuild` step.
- Migrations: numbered array in `src/main/db.ts`, recorded in `schema_migrations`. Full §3 schema is
  migration 1, plus a `scheduler_log` table (Phase 0 addition for the debug panel).
- Database file: `%APPDATA%\Secretary\secretary.db` (WAL mode, foreign keys on).
- Tray icon (`resources/tray.png`), window close hides to tray, app keeps running. Tray menu: Open / Start with Windows / Quit.
- Single-instance lock: a second launch focuses the existing window.
- Scheduler (`src/main/scheduler.ts`): 30 s `setInterval` tick over `reminders WHERE state='pending' AND fire_at_utc <= now`.
  State is written `pending → delivered` **before** the toast is shown. A tick also runs on `powerMonitor` resume.
- Startup sweep: overdue pending reminders are delivered at launch, marked missed, with lateness in the toast title.
- Windows toasts via `Notification` with `app.setAppUserModelId('com.suhani.secretary')`. Confirmed `notify.shown` fires.
- Start with Windows: `app.setLoginItemSettings` registers `electron.exe <projectDir> --hidden` in HKCU Run.
  Default ON on first launch; persisted in `settings.open_at_login`. `--hidden` starts in tray with no window.
- Renderer: crude input (title + datetime-local) writing to `items` (+ `reminders`), quick-test buttons
  (+1 min, +5 min, 10 min in the past, test toast), reminders/items lists, app info, scheduler log (last 50).
- IPC is typed via `src/shared/types.ts`; the renderer only sees `window.api` from the preload.

## Known quirks
- npm 11.19 blocks package install scripts by default ("allowScripts"). After `npm install`, if
  `node_modules/electron/dist/electron.exe` is missing, run `node node_modules/electron/install.js`.
- `vite` must stay on ^7 and `@vitejs/plugin-react` on ^5 — `electron-vite` 5 does not accept Vite 8.
- Dev hook: `SECRETARY_SCREENSHOT=<path.png>` saves a window screenshot ~2.5 s after load and quits.
- Toasts appear attributed to "electron.app.Secretary"-style identity while unpackaged; that's expected in dev.

## Verified on the user's machine (2026-09-15)
- Missed-reminder path: reminder due 12 min earlier, app closed, launched → delivered as "Missed reminder (12 min late)", toast shown.
- Live tick: reminder 40 s ahead fired on the next 30 s tick, toast shown, closed → acknowledged.
- User test: clicked "+5 min", closed the window (hidden to tray), toast fired 5 min later from the tray copy.
- Start-with-Windows entry exists in HKCU Run as `com.suhani.secretary`.

## What's untested
- The strict §7 test (Quit the app, restart Windows, don't open it, reminder still fires) — user chose not to
  restart. Everything it depends on is in place (Run entry, --hidden start, sweep), but it has not been observed.
  Re-offer it before Phase 1 is declared finished, or whenever convenient.
- Laptop lid close / hibernate not yet tested by actually doing it (spec §8).

## Commands
- User opens the app by double-clicking `Start Secretary.cmd` (their terminal panel has no `npx` on PATH).
- `npm run build` then `npx electron .` — build and run. `npm start` does both.
- `npx electron . --hidden` — run in tray only (what Windows startup does).
- `npm run typecheck`

## Next
- Phase 1 (do not start until §7 Phase 0 test passes): orchestrator, Gemini provider behind an interface,
  Zod-validated tools, transactional execution, `extractions` audit log. API key comes from `.env`
  (`GEMINI_API_KEY`), which is git-ignored.
